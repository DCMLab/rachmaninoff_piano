============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 4, '3/8', 'v/iv{') ms3.Parse.rachmaninoff_piano.op42_17 --
	The label 'v/iv{' in m. 4, onset 3/8 (MC 4, onset 3/8) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('1', '3', '5') [('D', 'F', 'A')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 29 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.9354838709677419 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 6, '1/2', 'v(#11)/iv') ms3.Parse.rachmaninoff_piano.op42_17 --
	The label 'v(#11)/iv' in m. 6, onset 1/2 (MC 6, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).

	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 9 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.9 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
