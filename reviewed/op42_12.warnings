Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

FIRST_BAR_MISSING_TEMPO_MARK_WARNING (29,) ms3.Parse.rachmaninoff_piano.op42_12
	No metronome mark found in the first measure nor anywhere else in the score.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 2, '1/4', 'V6(#2)') ms3.Parse.rachmaninoff_piano.op42_12
	The label 'V6(#2)' in m. 2, onset 1/4 (MC 2, onset 1/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('#6', '2', '5') [('B', 'E', 'A')].
	The corresponding score segment has 0 within-label and 2 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 1.0 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 17, '1/2', 'V7/ii') ms3.Parse.rachmaninoff_piano.op42_12
	The label 'V7/ii' in m. 17, onset 1/2 (MC 17, onset 1/2) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees
	('#6', '#1', '#3', '5') [('B', 'D#', 'F#', 'A')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets,
	a ratio of 0.8 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed
	by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
