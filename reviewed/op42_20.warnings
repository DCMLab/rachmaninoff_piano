DCML_HARMONY_SYNTAX_WARNING (15,) ms3.Parse.rachmaninoff_piano.op42_20 --
	Score contains 1 labels that don't (and 100 that do) match the DCML standard:
	    mc  mn       label harmony_layer
	42  17  17  VIM4|EC}{3             1
DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 15, '3/16', 'IV64') ms3.Parse.rachmaninoff_piano.op42_20 --
	The label 'IV64' in m. 15, onset 3/16 (MC 15, onset 3/16) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('1', '4', '#6') [('D', 'G', 'B')].
	The corresponding score segment has 3 within-label and 6 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.6666666666666666 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
