Warnings encountered during the last execution of ms3 review
============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 6, '21/4', '#i%65') ms3.Parse.rachmaninoff_piano.op42_13b --
	The label '#i%65' in m. 6, onset 21/4 (MC 6, onset 21/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of d.i, it expresses the scale degrees ('#3', '5', '#7', '#1') [('F#', 'A', 'C#', 'D#')].
	The corresponding score segment has 2 within-label and 6 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.75 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
